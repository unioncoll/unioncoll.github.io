### Hi, I'm Adam Mazel.

I'm the Digital Scholarship and Instruction Librarian at [Union College](https://www.union.edu) in Schenectady, NY. There, I teach and facilitate traditional, digital, and open scholarship and pedagogy.

My M.S. in Library and Information Science is from Simmons University, and my Ph.D. in English Language and Literature is from the University of Michigan. I have nearly 10 years experience teaching in higher education, and my peer-reviewed articles are in Victorian Literature and Culture, Victorian Poetry, and Nineteenth-Century Literature.
